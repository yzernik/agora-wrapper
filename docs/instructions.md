# Explanation

Upon starting up, Agora will receive a unique directory inside File Browser. Any file you place inside this directory will be displayed in Agora.

You can let people view your files for free, or require them to pay you in Bitcoin over the Lightning Network to download and view your files.

# Getting Started

## Config

Decide which directory in File Browser will be used, choose your preferred lightning implementation (LND or CLN), and set your default price for file downloads. Your chosen directory is automatically created inside File Browser, along with a sample file for testing.

## Adding new files

Open `File Browser` and add files to your Agora directory. You can create sub directories as well. By creating sub directories, you can customize the appearance and price of files inside that directory. Learn more about access configuration [here](https://github.com/agora-org/agora#access-configuration).

## Sharing your files

Simply share your Agora Tor address (found in **"Interfaces"**). Do not share your Agora LAN address, as that is only accessible to someone who is connected to you LAN.
